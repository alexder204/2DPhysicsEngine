# 2DPhysicsEngine
## Overview
A 2D physics engine built with Python that simulates physical interactions such as motion, gravity, and collisions between objects. 
There are a multitude of object types.
This project demonstrates an understanding of physics concepts, vector math, and object-oriented programming.

### This project includes:
- Object motion based on velocity and acceleration
- Gravity simulation
- Elastic collisions between circular objects
- Boundary constraints (objects bounce off screen edges)
- Customizable parameters: mass, friction, restitution, etc.
