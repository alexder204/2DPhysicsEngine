# 2DPhysicsEngine

## Overview
A **2D physics engine** built with **Python** that simulates physical interactions such as motion, gravity, and collisions between objects.  
There are multiple object types included.  
This project demonstrates an understanding of **physics concepts**, **vector math**, and **object-oriented programming**.

---

## Features
- **Object motion** based on velocity and acceleration  
- **Gravity simulation**  
- **Elastic collisions** between circular objects  
- **Boundary constraints** — objects bounce off screen edges  
- **Customizable parameters:** mass, friction, restitution, and more
